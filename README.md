## 📣 News
* ⏳⏳⏳ Training a stronger model with the help of Open-Sora-Plan (e.g 65 x 512 × 512).
* ⏳⏳⏳ Release MagicTime and ChronoMagic dataset.
* **[2024.04.08]**  🔥 **All codes & datasets** are coming soon! Welcome to **watch** 👀 this repository for the latest updates.

## 😮 Highlights

MagicTIme shows excellent performance in metamorphic video generation.

### 🔥 High performance, but with fewer parameters
- with just **3B sparsely activated parameters**, MoE-LLaVA demonstrates performance comparable to the LLaVA-1.5-7B on various visual understanding datasets and even surpasses the LLaVA-1.5-13B in object hallucination benchmarks.

### 🚀 Simple baseline, learning multi-modal interactions with sparse pathways.
- With the addition of **a simple MoE tuning stage**, we can complete the training of MoE-LLaVA on **8 A100 GPUs** within 1 days.
